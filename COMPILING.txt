Directory layout
----------------

  craftbook/
    <contents of craftbook repo here>
    lib/
	    WorldEdit.jar (Required)
	    
	    minecraft_server.jar (Optional, Required for Hmod Builds)
	    Minecraft_Mod.jar (Optional, Required for Hmod Builds)
	    
	    bukkit.jar (Optional, Required for Bukkit Builds)
	    
	    JFlex.jar (Optional)

Change to the craftbook directory, and execute 'ant' to generate CraftBook.jar,
which you can then install as normal. (see INSTALL.txt) JFlex is not needed for
this operation, however, this will build CraftBook for both hMod, and Bukkit.

If you only need the resulting CraftBook.jar to work on hMod, execute
'ant build-hmod' instead of just 'ant'. If you only need it to work on Bukkit,
execute 'ant build-bukkit' instead.

Note that if the grammar definition files (they have the .lex extension) are
modified, you must run 'ant run-jflex' for your changes to take effect. Jflex
is required for this operation. It should also be noted that the .lex files
re-compiled by run-jflex are hardcoded, and build.xml must be modified to add
new ones.
